        <p>This app was created during my 2024 summer semester as a group project where we had to work with the designated company we were given, each person was given a role in what they had to design and all together come up with a business plan. For this business we were working with a community supported agriculture where they took pride in giving the community fresh produce year-round and to educate them on the importance of supporting local farmers. </p>

           <p>During my spring semester I was able to work on an app of my choice, for this project I created an app for local artists to use so that they could easily book venues and get connected with different bars in their areas. It also allowed for them to connect and interact with the community around them so that they could find their target audience and build up their fan base on a closer level.</p>
